# Quiz Handlers

This is a simple react project.

## About this project

In this project the home page is named "Topics". There are four options here, which can be tested by an user. 
A user can select the topic which will route him/her to another page where several questions will be shown base on his/her chosen topic.
If they choose the right answer, a toast will inform the answer is correct. If the chosen answer is wrong then it will show that it's wrong. 
A icon also added to show the right answers as well.

There is also a statisticsw page where a chart is made base on the number of questions present in each topic.

The blog page will give some answers about useRef, context api and the purpose of react routing.

An animation also added in the Topics page as well.

Hope you will like the project.

Thanks!!!
